synopsis: "Path-based dispatch: js_of_ocaml-specific support"
description: """
ocaml-dispatch provides a basic mechanism for dispatching a request to a
handler based on hierarchical path names conventionally found in URIs. It can be
used both for dispatching requests in a server, as well as handing changes to
hierarchical fragments in a client-side application.

This library provides a JavaScript interface for dispatching
events based on DOM events.

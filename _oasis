Version:     0.2.0
Synopsis:    Path-based dispatching for client- and server-side applications.
Description: Dispatch provides a basic mechanism for dispatching a request to a
  handler based on hierarchical path names conventionally found in URIs. It can be
  used both for dispatching requests in a server, as well as handing changes to
  hierarchical fragments in a client-side application.
